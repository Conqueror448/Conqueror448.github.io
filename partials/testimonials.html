                                "Eric has a natural curiosity that fuels him as a technical problem solver. <br>
                                He is an excellent technical mentor, who helped me greatly in SAP as we worked together to improve production, scrap, and uptime reporting. <br>
                                He has a desire for continuous improvement and the technical skill set to greatly benefit any team. I really enjoyed working with Eric, and we accomplished much at Sabic together."
